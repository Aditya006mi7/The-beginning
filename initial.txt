I am a guy trying to wrap his head round 'git'Hub
running into 'gits' like ... who knows
in a vast jungle of tutorials...
don't get me wrong, I did find some good ones...
but many a times the best way to learn a technology is ...
to 'git' started with it and figure out what it does...
The Big Bang.
I am a student trying to learn how to use github, but...
running into dead ends...
in an extensive jungle of information...
don't get me wrong, I did find some useful info...
but many a times the best way to learn a technology is ...
to start using it and figure out what it does...
The start.
