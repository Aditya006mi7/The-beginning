I am a guy trying to wrap his head round 'git'Hub
running into 'gits' like ... who knows
in a vast jungle of tutorials...
don't get me wrong, I did find some good ones...
but many a times the best way to learn a technology is ...
to 'git' started with it and figure out what it does...
The Big Bang.
